# Explanation
- It's a technique that can be used to implement Dynamic Relocation (AKA hardware-based address translation) (refer to [[Memory Virtualization]]).
- Involves two registers per CPU:
	- *Base*: used to transform virtual addresses.
	- *Bounds*: ensures that the generated addresses are within the confines of the #address_space.
- Mechanism:
	1. Each program is written and compiled is if it is loaded at address zero.
	2. When the program starts to run, the OS decides where in physical memory it should be loaded and set the base register to that value.
	3. When any memory reference is generated by the process, it is translated by the MMU as follows: `physical address = virtual address + base`. Then the hardware fetches the bytes in the resulting physical address.
- Support needed from the hardware:
	- A single bit on the CPU indicating the operation mode (refer to [[Limited Direct Execution]]).
	- Special instructions to modify the contents of the base and bounds registers.
		- Should be privileged (can only run in #kernel_mode).
		- Allows the OS to change base and bounds when different processes run.
	- Generating exceptions when the user program tries to access memory illegally.
- Operating System responsibilities:
	- Find free space when a new process enters the system.
		- By searching a data structure (often called the free list) to find room for that process.
	- Reclaim the memory allocated for a process after it termination.
	- Save and restore the base and bounds when switching between processes.
	- Free up space for new processes by relocating the address spaces of others.

- Advantages:
	- Very little translation overhead.
	- Transparency: the process is unaware of the base/bounds pair or its location in physical memory.
	- Protection: no process can generate memory references outside of its own #address_space.
- Disadvantages:
	- Assumes that all processes are of the same size and that size is fixed.
	- *Internal Fragmentation*: there are a lot of wasted space between the heap and the stack.
