# Explanation
- *Principle of Locality*: Programs tend to use data and instruction with addresses near or equal to those they have used recently.
- Types:
	- *Temporal locality*: Recently referenced items are likely to be referenced again in the near future.
	- *Spatial locality*: Items with nearby addresses tend to be referenced close together in time.
- Well written programs tend to exhibit locality.
- Locality of reference is the fundamental idea behind the [[Memory Hierarchy]].
