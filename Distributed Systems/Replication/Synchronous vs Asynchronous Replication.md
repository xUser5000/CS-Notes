| Replication Mode     | Description                                                                                                                                          | Advantages                                                                                          | Disadvantages                                                                                                                                           |

| **Synchronous**      | Leader waits for a response from a follower before confirming the write and making it visible to other clients.                                      | - Guaranteed consistency between leader and follower.  <br> - Data still available if leader fails. | - Write cannot proceed if the synchronous follower is unresponsive. <br> - Not feasible to make all followers synchronous due to availability concerns. |
| **Semi-Synchronous** | One follower is synchronous; others are asynchronous. If the synchronous follower fails or slows down, an async follower is promoted to synchronous. |                                                                                                     | - More complex management logic (e.g., promoting async to sync).                                                                                        |
| **Asynchronous**     | Leader sends the write to followers but does not wait for acknowledgment.                                                                            | - Leader can process writes even if all followers are lagging.                                      | - Writes may be lost if the leader crashes before replication. <br> - No durability guarantees, even if write was acknowledged to the client.           |
