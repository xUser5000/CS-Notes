# Explanation
- *Distributed System*: A collection of independent computers that appear to the users of the system as a single computer.

## Why do people build distributed systems?
- to increase capacity via parallelism,
- to tolerate faults via replication,
- to place computing physically close to external entities, and
- to achieve security via isolation.

## Challenges in distributed systems
- They have many concurrent parts.
- They must cope with partial failures.
- It's tricky to realize performance potential.
