# Explanation
- The operating system is the body of software responsible for:
	- Making it easy to run programs
	- Seemingly running multiple programs at the same time
	- Allowing programs to share memory
	- Enabling programs to interact with devices (e.g, disks, printers, etc...)
- In the early days, operating systems were just a set of libraries of commonly-used functions.
