# Explanation
- A twisted pair consists of two insulated copper wires, typically about 1 mm thick.
- The wires are twisted together in a helical form, just like a DNA molecule.
- When the wires are twisted, the waves from different twists cancel out, so the wire radiates less effectively.
- A signal is usually carried as the difference in voltage between two wires.
	- This provides immunity to external noise because the noise tends to affect both wires the same, leaving the difference unchanged.
- The most common application of the twisted pair is the telephone system.
- The garden variety deployed in many office buildings is called Category 5 cabling, or "Cat 5".
- Different LAN standards may use the twisted pairs differently.
	- Example: 100-Mbps Ethernet uses two (out of the four) pairs, one pair for each direction.
