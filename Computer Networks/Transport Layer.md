# Explanation
- The transport layer builds on the [[Network Layer]] to provide data transport from a process on a source machine to a process on a destination machine with a desired level of reliability that is independent of the physical networks currently in use.
	- It provides the abstractions that applications need to use the network.
- *Transport Entity*: software and/or hardware within the transport layer that does the work.
	- It can be located in the [[Operating Systems|operating system]]'s kernel, a library package bound into network applications, in a separate users [[Process|process]], or even on the network interface card.
