# Explanation
- A coaxial cable consists of a stiff copper wire as the core, surrounded by an insulating material.
- The insulator is encased by a cylindrical conductor, often as a closely woven braided mesh.
- The outer conductor is covered in a protective plastic sheath.
- The construction and shielding of the coaxial cable give it a good combination of high bandwidth and excellent noise immunity.
- It has better shielding and greater bandwidth than unshielded twisted pairs, so it can span longer distances at higher speeds.
- Modern cables have a bandwidth of up to a few GHz.
- Kinds:
	- **50-ohm cable**: commonly used when it is intended for digital transmission from the start.
	- **75-ohm cable**: is commonly used for analog transmission and cable television.
