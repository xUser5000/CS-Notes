- Fiber optics are used for long-haul transmission in network backbones, high-speed LANs, and high-speed Internet access such as FttH (Fiber to the Home).

### Structure
- The core of a fiber cable is surrounded by a glass cladding with a lower index of refraction that the core, to keep all the light in the core.
- A thin plastic jacket protects the cladding.
- Fibers are typically grouped in bundles, protected by an outer sheath.
- Terrestrial fiber sheaths are normally laid in the ground within a meter of the surface.

### Mechanism
- An optical transmission system has three key components: the light source, the transmission medium, and the detector.
-  Conventionally, a pulse of light indicates a 1 bit and the absence of light indicates a 0 bit.
- The transmission medium is an ultra-thin fiber of glass.
- The detector generates an electrical pulse when light falls on it.
- By attaching a light source to one end of an optical fiber and a detector to the other, we have a unidirectional data transmission system that accepts an electrical signal, converts and transmits it by light pulses, and then reconverts the output to an electrical signal at the receiving end.
- Two kinds of light sources are typically used to do the signaling:
	- LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes)
	- Semiconductor lasers.
- The receiving end of an optical fiber consists of a photodiode, which gives off an electrical pulse when struck by light.
	- The response time of photodiodes, which convert the signal from the optical to the electrical domain, limits data rates to about 100 Gbps.
