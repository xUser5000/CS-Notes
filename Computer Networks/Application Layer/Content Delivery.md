# Explanation
- In today's internet, the location doesn't matter for content,
	- meaning that it doesn't matter which computer serves the content.
- There is a small number of websites with massive traffic and a vast number of websites with much smaller traffic.
- To meet the consumers' demand and reduce the endless delays in the internet, two solutions have been developed:
	- *Content Delivery Networks*: networks in which data centers are spread around the world to serve content to an extremely large number of clients with good performance and availability.
		- Large content providers (e.g., YouTube) build their own content distribution networks.
	- *Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks*: networks in which a collection of computers pool their resources to serve content to each other, without separately provisioned servers or any central point of control.
