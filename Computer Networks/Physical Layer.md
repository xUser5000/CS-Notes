# Explanation
- The physical layer defines the electrical, timing, and other interfaces by which bits are sent as signals over channels.
- No transmission facility can transmit signals without losing some power in the process.
- Usually, for a wire, the amplitudes are transmitted mostly undiminished from 0 up to some frequency $f_c$ (measured in cycles/sec or Hertz Hz).
	- All frequencies above this cutoff frequency is attenuated.
- *Bandwidth*: the width of the frequency range transmitted without being strongly attenuated.
	- The bandwidth is a physical property of the transmission medium that depends on, for example, the construction, thickness, and length of a wire or fiber.
- In practice, the cutoff is not really sharp, so often the quoted bandwidth is from 0 to the frequency at which the received power has fallen by half.
- Filters are often used to further limit the bandwidth of a signal.
