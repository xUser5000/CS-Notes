# Explanation
- The Internet is a vast collection of different networks that use certain common protocols and provide certain common services.
- To join the internet, the computer is connected to an **Internet Service Provider (ISP)**, letting the computer exchange packets with all of the other accessible hosts on the internet.
	- The computer is typically connected to a [[Modem]] that converts digital packets to analog signals that can pass unhindered over the telephone line.
	- At the other end, a device called a DSLAM (Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer) converts between signals and packets.
- *Point of Presence (POP)*: the location at which customer packets enter the ISP network for service.

- *Dial-up*: a method for connecting home computers with the ISP by reusing the telephone line.
	- Has a limited bandwidth (~56 Kbps).
	- If the line is currently used to deliver internet connection, it can't be used to make phone calls, or vice versa.
- *Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)*: just like dial-up, it's a method for connecting home computers with the ISP by reusing the telephone line.
	- It has much higher bandwidth compared to dial-up.
	- Can be used simultaneously to deliver internet connection and make phone calls.
- *Broadband*: a term used to describe internet access at much greater speeds than dial-up.

- ISPs connect their networks to exchange traffic at IXPs (Internet eXchange Points).
	- *IXP*: a room full of routers, at least one per ISP.
