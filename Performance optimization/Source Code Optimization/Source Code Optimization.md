# Explanation
- Because optimizing compilers have some limitations ([[Compiler-level Optimization#Limitations]]), it's the responsibility of the programmer to write compiler-friendly code.
- There are some general useful optimization tricks like:
	- [[Code Motion]]
	- [[Strength Reduction]]
	- [[Abstracting Common Sub-expressions]]
	- [[Loop Unrolling]]
	- Vectorized computations using SIMD (single instruction, multiple data).
