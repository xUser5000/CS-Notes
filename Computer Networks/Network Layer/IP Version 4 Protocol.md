# Explanation
- An IPv4 datagram consists of a header part and a body or payload part.

## Header Structure

### Illustration

### Description
- The header has a 20-byte fixed part and a variable-length optional part.
- The bits are transmitted from left to right and top to bottom, with the high-order bit of the *Version* field going first.

| Strict source routing                  | Gives the complete path from source to destination as a sequence of IP addresses.                                                                  | - The datagram is required to follow that exact route.<br>- Useful to send emergency packets when the routing tables have been corrupted, or for making timing measurements.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Loose source routing                   | Requires the packet to traverse the list of routers specified, in the order specified, but it is allowed to pass through other routers on the way. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Record route                           | Tells each router along the path to append its IP address to the Options field.                                                                    | This allows system managers to track down bugs in the routing algorithms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Timestamp                              | like the *Record route* option, except that in addition to recording its 32-bit IP address, each router also records a 32-bit timestamp.           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
